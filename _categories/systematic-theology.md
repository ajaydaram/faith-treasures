Systematic theology is a discipline of Christian theology that formulates an orderly, rational, and coherent account of the doctrines of the Christian faith. It addresses theological topics one by one (e.g., God, humanity, salvation) and attempts to summarize all the biblical teaching on each particular subject.

## Key Topics

- **Theology Proper**: The study of the nature and attributes of God.
- **Christology**: The study of the person and work of Jesus Christ.
- **Pneumatology**: The study of the Holy Spirit.
- **Soteriology**: The study of salvation.
- **Ecclesiology**: The study of the church.
- **Eschatology**: The study of the end times.

## Importance

Systematic theology helps believers to understand and articulate their faith in a coherent and comprehensive manner. It also aids in defending the faith against misunderstandings and false teachings.
