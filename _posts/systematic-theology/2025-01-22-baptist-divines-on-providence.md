London Baptist Confession 1689 of Divine Providence
God upholds and directs all creation ensuring everything unfolds according to His infallible plan for His glory.
God, being the good Creator of everything, uses His infinite power and wisdom to sustain, direct, manage, and govern all creatures and things. This ranges from the greatest to the smallest creations. Through His wisest and holiest providence, He guides them toward their intended purpose, in accordance with His perfect foreknowledge and the free, unchangeable purpose of His will. All this brings praise to His glorious wisdom, power, justice, infinite goodness, and mercy.

Ephesians 1:11
Nothing happens by chance, even though events occur according to secondary causes (natural processes, free choices, etc.).
Although everything happens unchangeably and inevitably according to God's foreknowledge and decree (as the first cause), so that nothing happens by chance or outside His providence, He has arranged through this same providence that things occur according to their natural causes - whether necessarily, freely, or by circumstance.

God uses means to accomplish His will but can also work above or against them
While God typically works through normal means in His providence, He remains free to work without these means, beyond them, or even contrary to them as He chooses.

Even sinful acts are under His providential control, but God remains holy and never the author of sin
God's almighty power, unfathomable wisdom, and infinite goodness are so clearly shown in His providence that His definite plan extends even to the first sin and all other sinful actions of both angels and humans. This isn't merely passive permission - He wisely and powerfully restricts, arranges, and governs these actions in various ways to achieve His most holy purposes. However, the sinfulness of these acts comes only from the creatures themselves, not from God, who being perfectly holy and righteous, neither causes nor approves of sin.

God allows trials for His children to discipline, humble, and strengthen their dependence on Him, ensuring that everything works for their good and His glory.
The wisest, most righteous, and gracious God sometimes temporarily allows His own people to face various temptations and their own inner corruption. This serves to discipline them for their past sins, to reveal to them the hidden power of corruption and deception in their hearts (leading to humility), to draw them into closer and more constant reliance on Him, to make them more vigilant against future occasions of sin, and for other just and holy purposes. Therefore, whatever happens to His chosen ones is by His design, serving both His glory and their benefit.

16. Romans 8:28
God hardens the wicked as a righteous judge, giving them over to their own desires, which lead to further sin and judgment
Regarding those who are wicked and ungodly, whom God, as the righteous judge, blinds and hardens because of their previous sins: He not only withholds His grace (which could have enlightened their understanding and touched their hearts), but sometimes also takes away the gifts they had, and exposes them to situations where their corrupt nature leads them to sin. Furthermore, He allows them to be controlled by their own desires, worldly temptations, and Satan's influence. As a result, they harden themselves under the very same circumstances that God uses to soften others.

Godâ€™s providence has a special focus on His church, guiding all things for its ultimate good 
While God's providence extends to all creatures, He takes special care of His church and arranges everything for its benefit.
